Welcome to my profile! I've got an assortment of projects in active development in my repository tab, but if you're only interested in the cool stuff, check out my [portfolio repo](https://github.com/toasterrepairman/portfolio). I do my best to keep my projects updated with nice visuals to give passersby a better idea of what's happening internally.

Mostly native Linux software. I've got an actively maintained [Discord bot](https://github.com/toasterrepairman/egghead), some [public dotfiles](https://github.com/toasterrepairman/boostrap), and a couple [smaller](https://github.com/toasterrepairman/qlip) [tools](https://github.com/toasterrepairman/qubert).

Professionally, I'm most comfortable with SRE/DevOps work.
