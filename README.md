welcome to my profile! I've got an assortment of projects in active development in my repository tab, but if you're only interested in the cool stuff, click on the portfolio repo below. I do my best to keep my projects updated with nice visuals to give passersby a better idea of what's happening internally.

## Q/A
```
"can I hire you?"
```

not now. you can contact me at `smol@toast.cyou`, though!

```
"what do you build?"
```

mostly native Linux software. I'm currently working on [devtools](https://github.com/toasterrepairman/devtools), a handy toolkit for desktop developers. I also did a few dumb things like [qlip](https://github.com/toasterrepairman/qlip) and [rgtube](https://github.com/toasterrepairman/rgtube) to fill gaps in my daily workflow.

```
"music recommendations?"
```
