mostly native Linux software. I'm currently working on GTK GUI interfaces for assorted applications. I've also got an actively maintained [Discord bot](https://github.com/toasterrepairman/egghead), some [public dotfiles](https://github.com/toasterrepairman/boostrap), and a couple [smaller](https://github.com/toasterrepairman/qlip) [tools](https://github.com/toasterrepairman/qubert).

professionally, I'm also comfortable with SRE/DevOps work.
